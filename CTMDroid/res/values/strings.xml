	<string name="help"><b> Quick Search</b> \nThe Quick Search allows you to view transit times within an hour from when you select the stop.\n- Click on the magnifying glass to search for the desired stop. To find your bus stop you just need to type in the search bar the bus stop name o the bus stop number. I suggest to use the number, it\'s easiest and fastest, you can find it in the bus stop, it\'s written on a sticker with white font and blue background. Click on the desired stop to see transit times. \n- By clicking on the star bar displays the favorite stops (if any). \n\n<b>Favorites.</b>\n- When you see the name of a stop click on the star next to the bus stop name to add to favorites.\n- To delete a favorite stop, clear favorites in the page of the star next to the name of the stop.</string>
